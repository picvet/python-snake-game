# python-snake-game


## What I used

  - Python -> pygame
  
## How to play?

  - Just like the classic snake game
  - You just control the snake using keys
    UP, DOWN, LEFT and right
  - The goal is to eat the apple
  - If you bite yourself the game ends
  - If you hit the wall the game ends
  - The more apples you eat the more score you get
